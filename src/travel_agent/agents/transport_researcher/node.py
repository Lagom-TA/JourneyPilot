    candidates are the stops.  The **station** on a long-distance leg is the other
    one, and it was missing here for as long as this projection existed: the
    adjacency between a station and the traveller's first stop was silently
    dropped from the routable set, so the one leg most worth measuring shipped an
    invented duration in every single run.

    A station's point does not depend on which long-distance option was chosen, so
    a slot-bound admitted route is as good a source for it as the chosen one.

    There is a **third** kind of node: the Itinerary Planner may
    author a stop the researchers never proposed, and the server then resolves that
    authored name against a real place provider
    (``services/authored_place_resolution.py``).  Such a stop is located — it has a
    ``resolved_place_id`` and real coordinates — but it is **not** an admitted
    Candidate, so walking ``catalog.candidate_index()`` cannot see it.  Every
    connector gap naming it then reports "no located endpoint" forever, no matter
    how many retries run, and the hop ships an invented duration.
    ``placement_place_id`` is already authored-aware; this projection has to be too.

    The gap this closes had a **false negative baked into how it was watched for**:
    grepping ``no located endpoint for authored:…`` misses the common case.  A
    *successfully resolved* authored place answers with its provider id, so the line
    actually printed is ``no located endpoint for amap:poi:…``; the string
    ``authored:…`` only appears when the place stays *unresolved*, which is the rare
    case.  The projection therefore must locate by resolved place id as well.
