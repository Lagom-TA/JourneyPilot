    #   field ``day_count`` entries forces the composer to invent the rest.  Trip
    #   lengths in this deployment: 3 days ×122, 4 days ×40, 2 days ×15 — 90% are
    #   3–4 days, so 4 per kind is the smallest value that stops the invitation on

    Scoped long-distance transport is the one worker whose count is **not** a

    governs the unscoped connector packet, whose load is likewise structural.

    """Refuse a retrieved source no retrieval in this round returned, and give
    the survivors the transcript's own copy of what was retrieved.

    ``external_web`` is the one evidence channel the model authors itself, by
    design: a web retrieval has no Tool Gateway registry path, so its record has to
    come from the worker.  That is why it has to be checked here.  ``canonical_url``
    is optional on ``SourceRecord``, so an unchecked "web source" can name no page at
    all and still support verified facts — a citation with nothing behind it, which is
    worse than an uncited claim because the reader can see a source and cannot see
    that it is empty.

    Two conditions, both read against server-owned data: the source must name a
    page, and that page must be one a retrieval tool returned this round.  A
    failing source is dropped along with the facts that lean on it, which sends its
    candidate into the ordinary "not enough evidence" path rather than rejecting a
    whole round; the drop is logged, because a silent one is the shape this guard
    exists to prevent.

    The second condition is **unconditional** — do not gate it on the round having
    returned at least one URL.  That would leave the emptiest round, where no
    retrieval ran at all, as the one round where any well-formed URL is accepted,
    which is backwards: a round with no retrieval transcript has no web evidence, so
    it is exactly where a model-authored citation is least supported.  The two ways
    ``retrieved`` comes back empty — nothing ran, or something ran and returned no
    page — mean the same thing to a reader, and both drop.

    The survivors get ``snapshot`` written from the transcript, **not** from the
    packet.  The contract asks for the complete tool return verbatim and the server
    is holding it — asking the model to retype it spends output tokens to obtain a
    worse copy of something already in hand, and "verbatim" is the one property a
    re-typed copy cannot be trusted to have.  Keeping the field server-written also
    keeps it out of the model-facing schema, which is what takes the last thing a
    strict structured-output provider cannot express out of the Research Packet
    contract.

    ``rag_chunk`` is *not* judged here.  It obeys the same principle — a retrieved
    source the server did not watch come back is not evidence — but its transcript
    is a different one: RAG content reaches a worker through prompt injection, so
    it is never in the Tool Gateway messages.  :func:`_ground_rag_chunk_sources`
    grounds it against the chunks this round actually injected.

    ``lookups`` keeps each call whole — its query beside the identities it

    The pairing *is* the datum: it is what lets the funnel say "this identity came
    out of a call a chunk caused" without ever comparing the Provider's spelling
    to the corpus's.

    Each query is read from the envelope's own echoed ``query``, **never** from
    ``sanitized_args_summary``: the summary is a rendered, truncated string, and
    reading a derived rendering as if it were the datum is how a hand-copied

    envelope, and — for ``dining`` only — the web retrieval that corroborated
    that place, whose id is listed below under the web tool's own name.

    That third family is why ``external_web`` is rare rather than routine.  Every
    web retrieval in this repo goes through the Tool Gateway and carries an
    ``audit_id``, so when its result corroborates a dining place the server
    compiles it into an ``external_tool`` record itself and hands the model the
    id.  ``external_web`` is the channel for web evidence the server did *not*
    compile — a page the worker read that no listed id covers.  It stays a real
    channel (the grounding pass below accepts one whose URL this round retrieved),
    but a model that binds to the listed id instead is doing the better thing,
    and in practice that is what happens.

    Compiled failure records are deliberately absent.  They are merged into the
    packet server-side on every return path, so offering their ids here bought
    nothing and cost a great deal: it invited the model to hang candidate
    identity facts on a rejected source, which the packet contract then strips,
    turning a grounded round into a zero-candidate one.
