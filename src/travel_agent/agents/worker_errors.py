"""Standardized worker ``last_error`` prefixes for gate classification.

Workers write a single string into ``TravelAgentState.last_error``. Artifact Gate
and Candidate Gate classify with substring markers in
``orchestrator.provider_failure``. Prefixes make schema vs provider outcomes
explicit without a parallel structured error channel. The prefix constants
themselves live in ``entities/worker_failure_protocol.py`` so the classifier
(which sits upstream in the import graph) reads the same values.

    ``provider_empty_round`` is the honest empty-success signal computed by
    ``research_packet_output.provider_round_answered_empty``: the Provider
    completed its calls, reported zero hits, and nothing in the round failed.
    The Packet exception that surfaces afterwards is a *symptom* of having
    nothing to serialize, so it must not be attributed to the schema layer —
    ``schema_gate:`` names the wrong failure and classifies as deterministic,
    which closes the domain without the bounded targeted re-research that a
    legitimately empty Provider answer is entitled to.

    ``provider_capability_round`` is the same argument one step earlier in the
    call chain, computed by
    ``research_packet_output.provider_round_capability_declared``: the Gateway
    decided *before* any call that the Provider cannot answer the requested
    date.  It takes precedence over ``provider_empty_round`` because it is the
    more specific statement — the Provider did not merely find nothing, it was
    never asked — and because it is the one the next bounded round must read as
    "switch modality", not "ask the same Provider again".
