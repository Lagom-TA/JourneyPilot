    registry ``research_packet_output`` compiles out of this round's Tool
    Gateway transcript — ``_bind_source_content_hashes`` replaces any
    model-echoed copy with the registry record and rejects an id the registry
    does not hold — and only the server stamps ``lifecycle_status="rejected"``
    on it.  The pair is therefore exactly the set of calls that really failed
    or degraded this round.

    Nothing the worker can type is read as a failure any more.  A title ending
    in ``" degradation"`` and a snapshot ``error`` key are free text on a
    model-authored ``external_web`` source, so honoring them let a model burn a
    domain's targeted-research budget and exclude a healthy tool by naming one
    of its own sources.  The tool name, provider, and error text below are read
    only *after* a server record is in hand, and every one of those fields was
    written by the server too.

    Signatures intentionally contain a normalized reason category rather than
