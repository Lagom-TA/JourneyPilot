"""Typed-artifact integrity validation after Candidate admission.

Candidate Gate owns provider/content retry budgets. This gate only decides
whether a typed artifact is internally valid, or hands a content failure back
to Candidate Gate for classification while that gate still holds a targeted
research call for the worker. It never retries a provider itself.

A malformed or absent artifact is recorded and handed forward to the delivery
quality gate. The only route this gate spends itself is one bounded
composition repair for an itinerary model failure; once that budget is gone,
and past the closeout boundary, everything goes forward.
