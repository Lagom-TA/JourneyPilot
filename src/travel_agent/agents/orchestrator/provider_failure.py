"""Normalized provider-failure classification shared by orchestration gates.

The classifier deliberately works on error *categories*, never raw provider
payloads.  Candidate Gate owns the retry/circuit decision; Artifact Gate only
uses the same classification to decide whether an absent typed artifact is a
provider/model-content outcome or a true internal-contract failure.
