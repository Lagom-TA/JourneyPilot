"""Keep provider credentials out of the log, when the credential is in the URL.

Some web APIs take their key as a query parameter and offer no header form —
amap's Directions endpoints are the case this exists for. ``httpx`` logs one
INFO line per request containing the full URL, so the moment such a request is
made the key is in ``backend.log`` in clear text, and the log is grepped,
tailed and pasted into reports.

The redaction is a filter on the ``httpx`` logger rather than a change at each
call site: there is exactly one place that formats those lines, and a rule
applied there cannot be forgotten by the next provider that keys by query
string. Any module that mints a secret-bearing URL should call
:func:`install_query_secret_redaction` at import so the filter is in place
before its first request, in every entry point (server, script, test).

That import-time call is the load-bearing one and must not be moved into the
app's logging setup: a script, a unit test or a direct tool invocation that
imports the provider module without going through an entry point would then log
the key in clear text.  The logging entry points install it *as well* —
:func:`install_query_secret_redaction` is idempotent per logger name, so the
second call is a no-op and the filter never stacks — which covers the reverse
gap, a future provider that keys by query string and forgets its own call.
