"""The strict structured-output subset: one judge, one rewriter.

A provider that enforces this subset rejects a schema outright — it does not
degrade it the way a lenient provider does.  So a schema that is only legal on
lenient providers is a schema this application cannot ship: the first call to a
strict provider fails, every time, with nothing delivered.

This module states the subset once.  :func:`strict_schema_violations` is the
only judge of legality, and :func:`as_strict_schema` rewrites the two things
Pydantic emits that the subset forbids while carrying no meaning the subset
cannot express:

``oneOf`` → ``anyOf``
    A discriminated union's branches each pin their discriminator to a distinct
    ``const``, so at most one branch can ever match and the two keywords select
    the same thing.  The ``discriminator`` annotation itself is a JSON-Schema
    extension the subset has no slot for; it is a hint for the *generating*
    model, and the authoritative check is the Pydantic union on the way back in,
    which is untouched.

completing ``required``
    The subset has no notion of an optional property: a property is either
    required or absent from the schema.  A Pydantic field with a default lands
    in ``properties`` but not ``required``, which the subset reads as malformed.
    Completing ``required`` asks the generating model to emit the key it would
    otherwise have omitted.

What this module deliberately does *not* do is invent an encoding for a
free-form mapping (``additionalProperties`` anything other than ``False``).  The
subset has no way to say "arbitrary keys", so such a schema cannot be legalized
here — it has to change shape where the model declares it.  :func:`as_strict_schema`
raises rather than hand the transport something the provider will reject.
